# Binary Tree Visualizer 🌳

**Binary Tree Visualizer** is an interactive tool designed to simplify the understanding and representation of binary trees, binary search trees (BST), and max heaps. This project provides an intuitive platform to explore tree structures, perform operations, and visualize traversal outputs, making it an invaluable resource for learning and teaching data structures.

## Features
- 🌟 **Interactive Tree Visualization**: View the structure of binary trees, max heaps, and BSTs in real-time.
- ➕ **Node Operations**: Insert, delete, and modify nodes dynamically for various tree types.
- 🔄 **Traversals**: Perform and visualize tree traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder).
- ⚖️ **Max Heap Validation**: Automatically verify and maintain the max heap property.
- 🔍 **BST Operations**: Test insertion, deletion, and searching in a binary search tree.
- 📚 **Educational Tool**: Ideal for students, educators, and developers aiming to understand tree structures.
